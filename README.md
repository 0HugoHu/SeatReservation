# SearReservation
A WeChat Mini-Program for seat reservation and check-in for school study rooms.

# Notice
This App was developed during **2019 summer** when I was a freshman in university. The technology used in the project is inevitably outdated. This applet has been cancelled, so you can't scan the code directly to experience it.

# Introduction

Many software facilities at SWJTU-Leeds Joint School are still inadequate. Take the study rooms for example, according to the questionnaire, 73% of respondents believe that there are seats occupied by personal items in the study rooms. We desperately need a seat selection software to make efficient use of the scarce number as resources.

Features:

- Add 360Â° panoramic photo function / Show classroom facilities by icons.
- Three types of seating: general seating, seating with sockets, and with computer positions at a glance. Modular design, if you need to change the classroom seating, the background operation is very easy.
- Intuitive display of seat selection information for timely viewing. Allow cancellation of reservations to prevent default due to unforeseen events.
- Separate "My" screen for easy access to personal stats. Here you can view the number of hours of study, hourly ranking and my messages.
- **The location is assisted by searching for specific WIFI nearby to eliminate remote virtual check-in. If you do not arrive after making a reservation, the priority of seat selection will be reduced.**
